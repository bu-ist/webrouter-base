# The values in this file override the default host header which is the Host header that NGINX received ($host).
#
# Most entries will be of form:
# 
# backend_name $backend_hostname ;

# This will set the header to the backend/upstream hostname.  This is necessary for all 
# S3 buckets.

# This test entry is to a fixed value to simplify the test scripts
