# This map determines what scheme to use for the upstream request.  Most
# backends support both http and https but some backends (for example S3 buckets)
# only support http.  The default is $scheme and the external file backend_scheme.map
# allows the forcing of the backend.
#
# Most entries will be of form:
# 
# backend_name http ;
#
# This will cause the backend to only do http even if the original client request was through https.  Note
# that this only determines the scheme but the X-Method variables will be based on the original client connection.

# This test entry is to a fixed value to simplify the test scripts

# bi_backend always uses http
